# k-nearest-neighbour-search
EC504 Final Project: One of the standard problems in information retrieval is the nearest-neighbor problem. Given an object and a database, quickly retrieve the k-most similar objects to the query from the database. A naive implementation would require one to linearly scan through the entire database, which is typically too costly for online applications. Two common approaches that have been suggested for this problem are locality-sensitive hashing and k-d-trees. Both may be viewed as data structures / algorithms for finding an approximate nearest neighbor to a query. Other approaches such as R-trees exist. In this project, you will explore and implement these two techniques, and test them on a data set (for example, the 80 million tiny images dataset from MIT, where nearest neighbors can be computed directly using L2 distance over the computed gist features of these images; or a zip code locator based on latitude and longitude information). Compare the performance of these approaches in terms of speed and accuracy (i.e., how often do these methods retrieve one of the top few actual nearest neighbors).
